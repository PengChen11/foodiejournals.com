# foodiejournal.com PROJECT

**Attention:**

This project was origianlly initiated for Code fellows 401 python course as the final project.

As of July 20th 2020, the Code Fellows 401 python course was ended. Thus the end of group project.

As the owner of domain [foodiejournals.com](https://foodiejournals.com), I ([Peng Chen](https://github.com/PengChen11)) decided to keep working on this project at my personal time.
